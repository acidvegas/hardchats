# HARDCHATS

![](./.screens/preview.png)

## Features to add
- [ ] End-to-end encryption
- [ ] Screen sharing *(max of 2-3 users allowed)*
- [ ] Low bandwidth mode *(added but needs testing)*
- [ ] Add cookies to remember settings *(Name, Camera/Microphone device, etc)*

## Known bugs
- [ ] Browser noticiations for JOIN, QUIT, & CHAT is not working.
- [ ] Custom sounds for JOIN/QUIT/CHAT are not playing
- [ ] IRC connection Chrome-based browsers not working *(Tested via Vandium browser on GrapheneOS and Chromium on Linux/Windows)*
	- This might be because we have closed ports on some SuperNETs nodes I need to open still for websockets...
- [ ] Does not properly detect when a client quits so the cam gets frozen and the user remains in the user list still.
